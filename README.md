# Remembrance & Death Anniversary Events Website

This project is a multi-page static website that helps families and friends plan and celebrate the death anniversaries of their loved ones in a respectful and meaningful way. It focuses on providing information, event ideas, and emotional support so that people can honor memories while coping with grief.

## Features

- **Home page** presenting the concept of visiting special places on a death anniversary and showcasing premium event locations around the world (Austria, Portugal, France, England, Italy, etc.).
- **About page** explaining what a death anniversary is, why it is important, and practical tips on how to cope during such days.
- **Why Us / Services page** describing how the team supported families during COVID, ensured respectful last rites across religions, and offers affordable services.  
- **Places page** listing multiple themed event packages (Ever After, Lucky Charm, United Hearts, Crescent Moon) with different venues and price ranges.  
- **Experience / Testimonials page** sharing emotional stories and feedback from people who used the service to remember their loved ones.  
- **Contact page** providing phone numbers, email, and a quick enquiry section to reach the team.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 static pages (`home.html`, `about.html`, `why.html`, `places.html`, `experience.html`, `contact.html`).
- Basic CSS (inline or linked) for layout and typography (you can extend with your own styles or frameworks like Bootstrap).  
- No backend or database is required; can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `home.html` directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. Use the navigation links (if present) or open other `.html` files to browse different sections of the site.

## Possible Improvements

- Add a global navigation bar between pages for smoother UX.  
- Apply a consistent CSS stylesheet for typography, colors, and layout.  
- Make the site mobile-responsive using media queries or a CSS framework.  
- Integrate a backend or form service (e.g., Formspree) to handle real contact form submissions.
